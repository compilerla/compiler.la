We first put together a list like this in the summer of 2021, when we received 242 applicants for our first-ever hire, a senior software engineer.
Every time we hire, we receive an incredible batch of applications from a wide variety of individuals with an outpouring of interest from folks
who, for the most part, have not had exposure to the ideas of “civic technology” or “public interest technology” or “government technology” as fields.

We can’t tell you how excited we are that there are so many people out there who are curious about working for or with
the government. The gov tech / civic tech / public interest tech space is a big one and helping others traverse this big space is important to us.
So, we’ve decided to not only continue sharing this list with our applicants but to move it out of a Google Doc and into a publicly accessible blog
post. We hope to publish an updated version as part of each round of hiring.

Below we’ve outlined some of our favorite agencies, companies, and resources to help you navigate a career in this nascent industry.

## Government Agencies with Digital Services Teams

“Digital Services” is loosely defined as agile teams that work similarly to a software
consultancy shop. They are deployed to work directly with subject matter experts in
other parts of the agency to assist in solving problems while using agile methodologies
and human-centered design. The most famous of these is probably the federal team,
18F, but states, counties, and cities are starting to launch their own. Below is a
list of some of our favorites.

*Note: federal jobs you often have to put together a federal resume which can easily
run 20 pages and take you a few weeks to assemble; there are really great
instructions on 18F’s website. If you’re interested, start working on that
resume now -- when jobs get posted they are usually only open for a few days
and that’s not enough time for you to put your resume in the necessary format.*

[California Office of Digital Innovation (ODI)](https://innovation.ca.gov/join-us/)

## Government Jobs Boards

Some of the great programming positions aren’t tied to big, new, splashy, digital
services teams; they often get syndicated on government career websites.
Some of these agencies are getting better at having their open positions posted
more broadly on sites like LinkedIn. As these jobs aren’t distributed widely,
sometimes they don’t get many applicants. These positions can also have
less obvious titles. For example, in the County of Los Angeles, programmers often
have the title Business Analyst. We suggest you broadly browse these job boards
and notice what kinds of titles are used to describe the skills you have.

Some of these jobs require you to pass an “exam” or “test” -- don’t stress too
much; do a bit of research. Sometimes these are standardized, multiple choice
exams you take with a pencil in a proctored room, while others are just a long-form
written version of your resume submitted via an online form. Do note that if
the position requires you to have passed an exam, you will need to do so before
you submit your application or they will auto-reject your application.

[State of CA: CalCareers](https://www.calcareers.ca.gov/): This site has so many jobs! You can create an account and get really specific email
notifications sent to you when a position opens that you might be qualified for or
within an agency you might be excited about working with.
  - CalCareers is confusing to learn how to navigate – [ODI has a really good guide](https://innovation.ca.gov/join-us/applying-civil-service-job/ ) to the state application process.

Private syndicate of gov jobs.
