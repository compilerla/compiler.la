## [1. Light Rail Snow Globe Ornament](https://shop.metro.net/collections/holiday-shop/products/light-rail-snow-globe-ornaments)
Whoever says “I have enough ornaments, I don’t need any more” is lying! They’re lying. They want more. And they absolutely want one with an adorable little train chugging her way through a winter wonderland. (If they weren’t lying, and they don’t want this, please send it to us).

## [2. NYC MTA Token T-shirt](https://onlyny.com/collections/tees/products/mta-token-t-shirt?variant=40202854039636)
For 3 years I lived down the block from the shop that sells these shirts, and I somehow never bought one. At the time I called it willpower but now I call it regret. *places order*

## [3. Go Metro Map Mug](https://shop.metro.net/collections/best-sellers/products/go-metro-map-mug)
For the person in your life who can never seem to remember when to make their transfer. As for when new lines are added? Put it on eBay and call it “retro”. Then suggest your friend get a boring ol’ non-mug map.

## [4. The People’s Transit Poster](https://transit.supply/collections/prints/products/san-francisco-the-peoples-transit-print)
Growing up my grandma had a poster like this but instead of railcars, it was dogs. My cousins and I would play a game where we’d all pick out our favorite one (and then pretend we were those dogs - but let’s pretend I didn’t just tell you that). That game is so much harder with this poster. Which one is my favorite, you ask? 1887! No, 1939! No, 1969. It’s too hard!! Pop this baby in a frame and you’re guaranteed to win “best gift” at the SF white elephant party this year.

## [5. Public Transit is Bussin’ T-Shirt](https://www.raygunsite.com/products/public-transit-is-bussin)
For that teenager in your life who thinks taking the train is “high-key cheugy”. Maybe this will change their mind. They might not get the pun right away, but baby steps, amirite??

## [6. NYC Parks T-shirt](https://onlyny.com/collections/tees/products/nyc-parks-logo-t-shirt-1?variant=40115599802452)
Not exactly transit-related but let’s face it, this shirt is just plain cute and that’s that. We love parks and that’s that.

## [7. Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Ring](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1084779169/massachusetts-bay-transportation?click_key=64ea237715a3dbd3437ea84b096768bbf6321f2c%3A1084779169&click_sum=ac5bc353&ref=user_profile&frs=1)
I suggest you wear one of these token rings and every time you fist bump someone make a loud beeping noise to let them know they can now board the train. No? Ok fine, but this is still an awesome ring that from a distance looks like a beautiful, vintage band but up close you realize is an absolute relic.

## [8. NYC Real-Time Subway Clock](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1290166234/nyc-realtime-subway-clock?click_key=b6b30f8f57cd4ba10f3bbc3ed29088e5aed6b156%3A1290166234&click_sum=98c95a73&ref=user_profile&frs=1&sts=1)
Idea: hang this in your living room and set it to all your friends' preferred lines to make sure your holiday party lasts until the last possible minute. Idea: hang this in your bedroom to ensure you get as many possible zzz’s before rolling out your door and down the subway stairs. Idea: hang this in your kitchen to give you peace of mind that you can enjoy your coffee without missing your train, or more realistically, so you can throw back your burning hot espresso when you look up and realize the L is 1 minute away. Idea: buy this.
