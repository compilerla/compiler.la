## How to write a blog post for Compiler
### How to write front matter

When you are getting ready to present your blog post draft, make sure you get your post [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) together. As the Jekyll doc states, "the front matter must be the first thing in the file and must take the form of valid YAML set between triple-dashed lines."

It begins and ends with `---`, and has the keys (like `layout`) separated from each key's values (like `blog_post`) with a colon (`:`). Here is an example from this post:

Once you've written the front matter, you're ready to dive into the main part - writing.

### Writing and formatting the post itself

When writing your post, make sure to include a full space between paragraphs. Sentences should have 1 space after the period, not 2. Remember, short paragraphs are easier for people to read.

In addition to paragraph of text, you can also include:
- Section titles (It’s a good practice to always have at least 2.)
- Section sub-titles (It’s a good practice to always have at least 2.)
- Graphic(s), illustration(s), chart(s), photograph(s) with captions. (Remember to include credit for the visual.)
- One pull quote
- Numbered lists
- Unordered lists
- Tables
- Links

Generally, the more you can break up paragraphs with non-paragraph elements, the better.


## Adding visuals

When appropriate, adding photographs, charts, illustrations with captions is a good idea. You **must** also include a sentence or two of `alt` text, which is what a screenreader reads out loud for those who are visually-impaired, to fully understand what the visual is trying to convey. Here are some [tips on how to write effective `alt` text](https://udayton.edu/blogs/onlinelearning/2021/07_07_2021_alttext.php).

<figure>
    <img src="/assets/compiler-team-photo-for-blog.jpg" alt="This is a caption underneath an image." />
    <figcaption>This is a caption underneath an image. Photograph by BYLINE</figcaption>
</figure>

### How to include a full-width visual

Trying to include a photograph, illustration or chart to your post? Great. Follow these steps:

1. Make sure to save the file at 500kB or less. Use [https://imagecompressor.com/](https://imagecompressor.com/) to compress a large image into a smaller one.
1. Make sure you get the name of the illustrator, photographer or chart-maker.
1. Write a caption. This caption should enable someone who is visually-impaired to understand the main gist of your visual.
1. Save the image in the `/assets/blog/` folder. Remember the filename.
1. Add the following code to your post, where you want the visual to appear. Fill in the filename, caption and byline with your own information:

```
<figure>
    <img
        src="/assets/blog/YOUR-FILENAME-HERE.jpg"
        alt="Your caption goes here." />
    <figcaption>Your caption goes here. Photograph by FIRST LAST.</figcaption>
</figure>
```

If you need help with any of these steps, ask for help from a developer in the #websites channel.

### How to include a half-width visual

<figure class="m-0 w-100 w-md-50 float-md-start pe-md-4">
    <img src="/assets/compiler-team-photo-for-blog.jpg" alt="This is a caption underneath an image." />
    <figcaption>This is a caption underneath an image. Photograph by BYLINE</figcaption>
</figure>

If you'd like your visual to take half the width of the post, instead of the full-width, follow these steps:

1. Follow steps 1-4 from the section above. **Note**: The caption also has to be 1/2 as long.
1. Add the following code to your post, where you want the visual to appear. Fill in the filename, caption and byline with your own information:

```
<figure class="m-0 w-100 w-md-50 float-md-start pe-md-4">
    <img
        class="w-50 h-50"
        src="/assets/blog/YOUR-FILENAME-HERE.jpg"
        alt="Shorter caption." />
    <figcaption>Shorter caption. Photograph by FIRST LAST.</figcaption>
</figure>
```

The visual will now appear in half the width.

## Give your most important point some visual flair

Now that you're at the end of this writing adventure, think back and ask yourself: If readers only remember one sentence, or one idea, what would you want that to be? What was the greatest revalation, the biggest thing that surprised you, in your writing process? Or perhaps it's the single-most shocking statistic. Find a sentence that reflects that idea. Give that sentence it's own paragraph. Add a `>` in front of that sentence.

> Always end your post with an empty line.

While there’s no character limit, design recommends 150 characters. The shorter the better! Editorial-wise, the sentence is best placed around the middle portion of your post - you don't want to leave the reader waiting _too_ long for your greatest epiphany.
