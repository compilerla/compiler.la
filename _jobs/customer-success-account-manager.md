## Role
The Customer Success team helps transit agencies take advantage of the various services offered by Cal-ITP. As an account manager, you will moderate and manage communication between Cal-ITP and the California transit agency customers assigned to you. You will be responsible for maintaining positive and supportive relationships with your assigned agencies and for identifying new opportunities to increase the quality of support provided by Cal-ITP. 

You will also be expected to document interactions and agency information in our Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system and to maintain a high-level understanding of Cal-ITP’s various programs and how your agencies are engaging with them. 

This role is client-facing. You’ll report to Anthony Rollins, and collaborate closely with Olivia Ramacier as well as with team members across Compiler and Cal-ITP, including the Payments, Mobility Service Data, and Data and Digital Services Teams.

You should be comfortable engaging with colleagues and technical specialists to get the appropriate answers to your customers’ questions. You may be asked to attend or moderate virtual meetings with technical specialists. You will document all interactions in the CRM.

- **Building the Customer Success Program at Cal-ITP** You will be an active participant in developing and improving the Customer Success program at Cal-ITP. You will provide input on the strengths and challenges of the current program, collect feedback from the agencies you work with to share internally, and participate in efforts to improve and document Cal-ITP’s approach to customer success.
