### How would you describe your role at Compiler?

I would say that my job is to make long term connections with the businesses that provide things we need to make riding the bus or train easier for people! My hope is that by becoming friends with these people we can work together for fun new projects that help people out!

### Who or what inspired you to pursue the career you have today?

I used to work in reality television, and then scripted television production after that. My idea was that I could bring positive change to people where they're at, sharing stories that truly meant something, seeing people on TV that look and act like they do. But the wealth inequality was too strong. And that struggle almost broke me. It did break me a few times - just ask about my head injury when I died in New Jersey! And so when I left my ABC sitcom in 2020 I knew there was a new path ahead of me, something more directly associated with my goals and interests. My 2016 viral map of the LA Metro expansion got me more and more interested in public transportation and how the quality of the service can change people's day-to-day lives!

### What is your most-used emoji?

ü§™ - I like that it's happy, whimsical, and an appropriate response to most things in this world.

### What Compiler philosophy do you resonate with the most? Why?

First and always inclusive - too often I hear non-riders say that they would take public transit if it were closer to their homes or went where they wanted to go. But they always neglect the bus system, the bus stops right outside of their homes. First and always inclusive reminds me that this is a PUBLIC service, meant to help EVERYONE, _even_ those with no other option. It's why I also believe in fareless transit, and resist the calls to ban the Unhoused from the system... These services are the lifeblood of our economy and if we forget that, we are leaving those most in need behind in favor of... a Disneyland style monorail funicular... I truly believe that public service for all is the goal here.

### How have you grown professionally while on our team?

Since starting at Compiler I have learned so much! My mind has exploded with transit! From all the acronyms, to even just behind the scenes work of what makes the wheels go 'round, I have appreciated everything I've learned. Transit was an interest and a hobby of mine, specifically the politics behind transit expansion, but now seeing the nuts and bolts of the technology that goes into everything once it's implemented has been eye opening.

### Which accomplishments are you most proud of?

In 2016, I created a map of the Los Angeles MetroRail and "expanded" the map to show the dreams of what our system could look like if the sales tax measure slated to be on the ballot would pass that Fall. I placed my image in tandem with the current network and created a "blinking gif." That gif went viral! It was written up in local newspapers and I was even interviewed by NPR in regards to the traction it was seeing. Once that sales tax measure passed, I was contacted by the then Mayor's office and asked if I'd be interested in a potential job with them. Having _just_ started on a hit television show, I turned them down... Over the next four years I learned many lessons about life and the world around me, and after all that I still ended up working in transit! Some things truly are just meant to be.

### How do you like to spend your free time?

If I have any free time, you can catch me on the Los Angeles MetroRail. When I first moved to LA I was so desperate to discover big city life, an escape from my Texan suburban roots. I discovered the Metro Red Line was my ticket from the San Fernando Valley all the way into Hollywood and beyond, into Downtown LA. I've hit the pavement walking all across Los Angeles just discovering new corners, small businesses, new cultures and cuisines. Anyone is welcome to join me any day!

### What‚Äôs a cause that you are passionate about?

EXPANDING TRANSIT! It is my number one passion, let's be honest. I truly believe there are so many social causes that are remedied by social programs, and the ability to expand those programs begins and ends with transit. I believe wealth inequality is the greatest plague to mankind, and providing access to jobs and culture to all can physically bridge the gap between the rich and the poor.
