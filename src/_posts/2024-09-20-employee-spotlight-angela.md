Before we dive into our interview with Angela, we want to officially kick off our new Employee Spotlight series. We here at Compiler are immensely proud of our team and we want to publicly celebrate that by giving our readers a peek behind the curtain. This will be the first of many interviews we will share about the unique contributions, skills, and interests of each of our team members.

So, first up–meet Angela! Angela has been with Compiler since the early days. As Compiler’s second hire, she has helped build the Compiler engineering practices. Managing Partner, Kegan Maher, has worked with Angela from day one. “Angela combines sharp intellect with unyielding reliability, always ready to take on new and often difficult responsibilities” says Kegan, “Her genuine compassion and care for the team exemplify her outstanding contribution to our collective success.” Kegan is not alone in these thoughts, Angela is a deeply valued member of our team. Read on to get to know more about Angela.

### What is your role at Compiler?
I’m a Senior Software Engineer

### How long have you been with Compiler?
I’ve been with Compiler since October 2021, so about 2.5 years.

### What is your favorite mode of transportation and why?
The train for going somewhere far. Bicycle for the pure joy!

### Who or what inspired you to pursue the career you have today?
I had a really hard time figuring out what career path to follow as a young adult because I felt pulled in many directions. It's obvious now looking back that even from an early age, what I really enjoyed was finding patterns and helping people by making things work. In my last year of college, I realized there could be a lot of opportunities to do both of those in software engineering, and it was the first time I felt really confident about a career choice.

### First public transit memory.
My first memory of choosing to take public transit is when I was in college. The city I grew up in is a small suburb and doesn't have any public transit, so I was excited to have access to the bus and to see where it could take me. During one of my first days on campus, I got on one of the buses and rode the whole route with a friend. It was a really fun way to explore a new place.

### How do you like to spend your free time? What are some (or one) of your hobbies?
In my free time, I like going on walks, exploring new bike paths, tracking my spending, and playing music.

### How have you grown professionally while on our team?
I've definitely grown professionally here at Compiler through observing good examples of giving and receiving feedback and then being able to practice them myself.

### Book you recommend?
A book I'd recommend is "Four Thousand Weeks" by Oliver Burkeman. There are lots of books about methods and systems for using your time well, but this book instead challenges the assumption that time is even a resource to be used at all. I like that it explores an idea that can shift your entire perspective.

### Podcast you recommend?
A podcast I'd recommend is "Don't Ask Tig." It's a comedy, advice podcast that I would listen to during a difficult time when I wasn't feeling very well, and it just made me laugh a lot.

### What do you love about living where you live? What are some of your favorite local spots to visit?
Where I currently live, I love that I can easily walk to a lot of things that I enjoy: there are lots of local restaurants and shops as well as the public library and a DART train station (the light-rail system in Dallas). One of my favorite spots to visit in Dallas is the Angelika Film Center right off SMU/Mockingbird Station.

### What’s the best trip you’ve ever been on and why?
The best trip in recent memory was when I went to Broken Bow, OK with my family. It was really nice to be out in nature and take in our surroundings together. Some highlights from it are when we hiked on a trail with lots of shade from the trees, explored different views around the lake, and had a picnic before catching the sunset.

### What’s your favorite memory from working with Compiler?
One of my favorite memories from working with Compiler is when we took an Amtrak train to Monterey, CA. Although there were quite a few unexpected events, and we arrived much later than we had planned, I really did enjoy taking the scenic route and having that unique experience with the team.
