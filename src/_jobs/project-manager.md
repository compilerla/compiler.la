Compiler is a small, woman-owned software consultancy. Compiler helps service-oriented government agencies build open source, human-centered, secure, agile solutions to support the delivery of government services that increase equity of opportunity.

Our team specializes in building software applications around data for operations support and performance management including: data standards development, data engineering, data cleaning, extract transform and load (ETL) workflows, custom application programming interface (API) development and integration, data integration, data pipelines, data analytics, and data science. Our team’s subject matter expertise in transportation, housing, and homelessness provides depth and quality to the services we design and the applications we build.

**About PeMS:** The Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS) application is a [multi-tier web application](https://pems.dot.ca.gov){:target="\_blank"}
that runs on a real-time transportation data warehouse. The traffic data displayed on the map is collected in real-time from over 39,000 individual detectors. These sensors span the freeway system across all major metropolitan areas of the State of California. PeMS is also an Archived Data User Service (ADUS) that provides over ten years of data for historical analysis. It integrates a wide variety of information from Caltrans and other local agency systems.

Compiler is expected to design, develop, and deploy upgraded functions to the PeMS web application. Upon project completion, Compiler is expected to hand over all source code with documentation to Caltrans.

## Role

The Project Manager role will be Compiler’s first official project management position. The project manager will work closely with Compiler’s software engineering team and client stakeholders to guide work on Compiler software and services projects, starting with the PeMS Modernization Update and Enhancement Services contract. You will oversee scoping of engineering work and defining success for projects. You are responsible for reporting on progress, task status, changes, issues, risks, and burndown of hours to Compiler team members and client stakeholders. You are accountable for administrative duties such as organization of project resources and artifacts, accurate and timely updates to project management software, and designing systems that allow stakeholders to locate the information needed to perform their jobs. You will anticipate what information will be needed, package it nicely, and make it easy for others to find and digest. To support the PeMS Modernization Update and Enhancement Services contract, you will maintain a high level understanding of the PeMS web application, its functions, data sources, users, and stakeholders.

This role is client-facing. You will report to Shelby Miller, Managing Partner, and collaborate closely with Kegan Maher, Managing Partner, and Luis Alvergue of Compiler’s Software Engineering team. You will have access to modern tools to help get your work done in a remote environment.

This is a full-time, salaried position (W-2) with benefits. Full-time employment at Compiler is thirty (30) hours per week.

## Responsibilities

- **Scope the project:** You will weave together agile and scrum methodologies with traditional project management principles to plan, execute, and support all phases and areas of the PeMS Modernization Update and Enhancement Services project, including defining and documenting project scope. You will work with team members internal and external to Compiler to scope each task and deliverable. Identifying, understanding, and communicating what is outside of scope is equally important as articulating what is within scope. Scope may evolve and change; you will uncover the details of the change, plan how to implement the change, and then implement and iterate on the change.
- **Proactive project management:** You will prioritize and champion clear communication that is succinct, candid, and kind. You will schedule, prepare for, and facilitate recurring and ad hoc meetings, and will document follow up items. You will be responsible for preparing and sharing contractually required reports, like monthly progress reports and timesheets, change logs, and final reports. You will be the first point of communication for items pertaining to their assigned project(s) for both internal and external team members.
- **Develop Compiler’s project management program:** This is the first official project manager position at Compiler. Therefore, you have the opportunity to influence and develop our philosophy on project management. You will be responsible for documenting and iterating on project and change management processes. A successful project management program requires time to be invested in creating a range of communication materials. You will document notes and learnings, create template artifacts, lists, and tasks in software systems, and will use integrations and automations to increase efficiency when available.
