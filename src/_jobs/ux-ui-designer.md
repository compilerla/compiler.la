Compiler is a small, woman-owned software consultancy. Compiler helps service-oriented government agencies build open source, human-centered, secure, agile solutions to support the delivery of government services that increase equity of opportunity.

Our team’s subject matter expertise in transportation, housing, and homelessness provides depth and quality to the services we design and the applications we build.

Our clients have included: City of Los Angeles, City of West Hollywood, CicLAvia, LA2050, Caltrans, California Department of Technology, County of Los Angeles, Southern California Association of Governments, MobilityData, and the California Community Foundation. Our recent work includes building and integrating payment and digital services technologies for public transportation agencies using Docker, Python/Django/Flask, and Azure.

As our only full-time UX/UI Designer, you’ll lead product design for two major portfolio projects: a transit benefit application and disaster recovery portal. The transit benefit application is grounded by multiple years of research and strategy, and supported by dedicated engineering and product teams that have dug into the details necessary for a digital government service to function well. You will guide the product design as the application scales from a successful pilot to a statewide service reaching millions of users. The disaster recovery portal project builds on the work of the transit benefits application. Both projects will include collaboration with different technical teams at the state level.

At Compiler, you’ll work with a small, dedicated team of [designers, product managers, and engineers](https://github.com/orgs/compilerla/people). We’re interested in building world-class digital services and innovating on public transit. In addition to our strong internal team, you’ll have access to additional external support for data privacy, data security, research or illustration.

This is a full-time, salaried position (W-2) with benefits. Full-time employment at Compiler is thirty (30) hours per week. The position is remote and based anywhere in the U.S. While it is remote, there is a strong preference for substantial overlap with Pacific Coast working hours.
