Compiler is a small, woman-owned software consultancy. Compiler helps service-oriented government agencies build open source, human-centered, secure, agile solutions to support the delivery of government services that increase equity of opportunity. Our clients have included: City of Los Angeles, City of West Hollywood, CicLAvia, LA2050, Caltrans, California Department of Technology, County of Los Angeles, Southern California Association of Governments, MobilityData, and the California Community Foundation. Our recent work includes building and integrating payment and digital services technologies for public transportation agencies using Docker, Python/Django/Flask, and Azure.

## About the project

Compiler supports the California Integrated Travel Project (Cal-ITP), a state-funded initiative to progress California towards a unified public transportation infrastructure. We support Cal-ITP in a variety of ways, including the design and development of Cal-ITP websites [calitp.org](https://calitp.org) and [California Mobility Marketplace](https://camobilitymarketplace.org).

This project/RFP focuses specifically on California Mobility Marketplace.
Established in 2021, California Mobility Marketplace makes it easy for public transportation agencies to browse and purchase statewide pre-approved contracts for new transit technologies to better serve riders. Mobility Marketplace is a direct response to the challenges small agencies face in navigating the procurement process. The site breaks down all the necessary steps to help agencies succeed—from real-time data to establishing a contactless fare system.

The current version of the website is challenging to navigate for the primary intended user - small California transit agencies - and is in the final stages of a redesign. The content, graphic design, and UX design are complete, but in order to finalize the full designs, we are in need of original art to display on a variety of pages.

## Scope of work

Compiler is seeking an illustrator or designer to collaboratively create a series of images that will communicate the program vision and values of Cal-ITP alongside information intended to help transit agencies in adopting new technologies that better serve transit riders in California. The illustrations will be decorative or explanatory in nature and should convey a friendly, inclusive, and accessible tone.

We are excited to partner with an illustrator on a unique visual language, however given the short timeline this project is more firm in its immediate scope. The following deliverables are requested:

- A “hero” illustration for the Home page (there is some flexibility with this one)
- A 404 page error illustration featuring a bus or a similar “Out of Service”/transit-oriented visual
- 7 original illustrations to be used on the Home page and individual product pages, to include:
  - A transit driver/operator (e.g. a bus driver)
  - A close up image of someone’s hand using a bank card to tap a payment acceptance device
  - A medium close-up depiction of a person using their bank card to tap a payment acceptance device while boarding a bus or train
  - A medium close-up depicting someone seated, using their phone casually and enjoying themselves on public transit
  - Two people looking together at a transit schedule (e.g. a poster showing routes, a bus schedule posted to a pole, etc.)
  - A hand holding a smartphone depicting a real-time bus route being tracked on screen in an app comparable to Transit App, near a bus stop
- 2 original illustrations to be determined in collaboration with successful applicant

Exclusive rights will be assigned to the client (Caltrans), you retain the rights for personal and professional use.

_Please note that we are only interested in partnering with an illustrator who creates original, non-AI generated art. We cannot accept AI-generated art at this time. We appreciate your understanding and acceptance of this policy if you choose to apply._

## Timeline

Beginning immediately with delivery terms by December 10, 2025.

## To Apply

There is potential for this scope to lead to future work for other Compiler-supported projects as well. The right candidate will be collaborative, organized, and excited about public transit. We are especially excited to receive proposals from individuals who themselves are users of public transit.

Applications will be accepted on a rolling basis beginning November, 6th 2025. Please submit your name, a very brief intro, a link to your work, and a draft budget for this scope using the linked form.
