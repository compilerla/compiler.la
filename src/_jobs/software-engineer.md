Compiler is a small, woman-owned software consultancy. Compiler helps service-oriented government agencies build open source, human-centered, secure, agile solutions to support the delivery of government services that increase equity of opportunity.

Our team specializes in building software applications that put both user and developer experience as top priorities. We write open source, well-tested and well-documented code by default. We stick to writing performant and accessible HTML and CSS with thoughtful use of JavaScript, and build robust experiences using progressive enhancement. In addition to custom web application and website development, our team’s portfolio includes: data standards development, data engineering, data cleaning, extract transform and load (ETL) workflows and pipelines, custom application programming interface (API) development and integration, data analytics, and data science. Our subject matter expertise in digital identity and transportation from the user experience of riders, operators, transit agencies, and more provides depth and quality to the services we design and the applications we build.

Our clients have included: City of Los Angeles, City of West Hollywood, CicLAvia, LA2050, Caltrans, California Department of Technology, County of Los Angeles, Southern California Association of Governments, MobilityData, and the California Community Foundation. Our recent work includes building and integrating payment and digital services technologies for public transportation agencies using Docker, Python/Django/Flask, and Azure.
