## Development

### Running a local instance

This is a [Jekyll][jekyll] static site. Development is done within a container-based environment using [VS Code with devcontainers](#vs-code-with-devcontainers). This repository includes a [`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`](devcontainer-config-file) file that configures remote container development.

Once inside the devcontainer in VS Code, you can press `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+B` to run the `Jekyll: Build Dev` [task](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks) defined in [`.vscode/tasks.json`][vscode-task-config-file], which builds the site and starts the Jekyll development server. The site will then be running at <http://localhost:4000>. Auto rebuild/reload will be active and will watch the site files for changes.

## VS Code with devcontainers

### Install the `Remote - Containers` extension

[VS Code][vscode] can be used together with Docker via the [Remote - Containers][vscode-containers] extension to enable a container-based development environment.
### Open the repository with VS Code

With the [Remote - Containers][vscode-containers] extension enabled, open the folder containing this repository inside Visual
Studio Code.

You should receive a prompt in the Visual Studio Code window; click `Reopen in Container` to run the development environment
inside a container.

If you do not receive a prompt, or when you feel like starting from a fresh environment:

1. `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P` to bring up the command palette in Visual Studio Code
1. Type `Remote-Containers` to filter the commands
1. Select `Rebuild and Reopen in Container`

### Exiting devcontainers

To close out of the container and re-open the directory locally in Visual Studio Code:

1. `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P` to bring up the command palette in Visual Studio Code
1. Type `Remote-Containers` to filter the commands
1. Select `Reopen Locally`
